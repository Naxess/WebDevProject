<!--https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/forms/-->
<div class="form-control">
    <p class="mb-1">
        Django's form functionality can be used to simplify and automate the process of handling forms and can do it
        more securely. Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-1">
        <li>Preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering</li>
        <li>Creating HTML forms for the data</li>
        <li>Receiving and processing submitted forms and the data from the client</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-0">
        While it's certainly possible to write the code manually, Django already has this functionality built-in so it's
        more time and labor efficient to make use of it.
    </p>

    <div class="form-control mb-2">
        <a id="html_forms_anchor"><h2>HTML Forms</h2></a>
        <p class="mb-1">
            In HTML, a form is a collection of elements inside &lt;form&gt; tag that allow users to do things like
            entering text, selecting options, manipulating objects/controls, etc.. and then send that information back
            to the server. Some of these elements are built-in and self-contained, while others may require CSS or
            Javascript to function. Like <em>&lt;input&gt;</em> elements, forms must specify two things:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-1">
            <li>
                <em>where</em>. This is the URL to which the data corresponding to the user's input should be returned.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>how</em>. This is the HTTP method the data should be returned by.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As an example, the login form for the Django admin contains three &lt;input&gt; elements. The input for the
            username has the <em>type</em> attribute set to <u>"text"</u>, the password input has the <em>type</em>
            attribute set to <u>"password"</u>, and the submit button has the <em>type</em> attribute set to
            <u>"submit"</u>. it also tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the URL specified in the
            &lt;form&gt;'s <em>action</em> attribute - <u>"/admin/"</u> - and that it should be sent using the HTTP
            mechanism specified by the <em>method</em> attribute: <u>"post"</u>. When the submit button is pressed, the
            data is sent to <em>/admin/</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="form-control mb-1">
            <a id="get_and_post_anchor"><h3><em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em></h3></a>
            <p>
                <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> are the only HTTP methods to use when dealing with forms.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                When a form is returned via the <em>POST</em> method, the browser bundles up the form data, encodes it
                for transmission, send it to the server, and then receives back its response.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <em>GET</em> method, by contrast, bundles the submitted data into a string, and uses this to compose
                a URL. The URL contains the address where the data must be sent, as well as the data keys and values.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>GET</em> and <em>POST</em> are typically used for different purposes. Any request that could be used
                to change the state of the system (e.g. changes to the database) should use <em>POST</em>. <em>GET</em>
                should be used only for requests that do not affect the state of the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>GET</em> is also unsuitable for a password form, because the password would appear in the URL, and
                thus, also in the browser history and server logs, all in plain text. It's also unsuitable for large
                quantities of data, or for binary data, such as an image. A web application that uses <em>GET</em>
                requests for admin forms is a security risk: it can be easy for an attacker to mimic a form's request to
                gain access to sensitive parts of the system.
                <br>
                <em>POST</em>, coupled with other protections like Django's <em>CSRF protection</em> offers more control
                over access. <em>GET</em> is more suitable for things like a web search form, because the URLs that
                represent a <em>GET</em> request can easily be bookmarked, shared, or resubmitted.
            </p>

    <div class="form-control mb-2">
        <a id="form_class_anchor"><h2>The <em>Form</em> Class</h2></a>
        <p>
            Central to this system of functionality is the <em>Form</em> class. This class describes a form and
            determines how it works and how it appears. The fields in a form class map to HTML form
            <em>&lt;input&gt;</em> elements. These fields are classes as well; they manage form data and perform
            validation when a form is submitted. (e.g. Datefield, FileField, CharField, etc..). A form field is
            represented to the user in the browser as an HTML widget - a piece of UI machinery. Each field type has a
            corresponding <em>Widget</em> class, but can be overriden as needed.
        </p>

        <div class="form-control mb-1">
            <a id="inst_proc_rend_forms_anchor"><h3>Instantiating, Processing, and Rendering Forms</h3></a>
            <p class="mb-1">
                Rendering an object in Django typically follows this schema:
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-1">
                <li>Retrieve the object into the views.py class</li>
                <li>Pass the object into the template context</li>
                <li>Expand it to HTML markup using template variables</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The way a form is rendered is very similar to the way other objects but there are some differences:
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-1">
                <li>
                    If a model instance contains no data, there's little that can be done with it, whereas an
                    unpopulated form is typically rendered without any value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When handling a model instance in the view, it's typically retrieved from the database. When dealing
                    with a form, it's typically instantiated in the view.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When instantiating a form, it can be left empty or prepopulated with data from the following
                    sources:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Data from a saved model instance</li>
                        <li>Data that has been collated from other sources</li>
                        <li>Data received from a previous HTML form submission</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="form-control mb-2">
        <a id="build_form_anchor"><h2>Building a Form</h2></a>
        <div class="form-control mb-2">
            <h5>An example of a manually-created form:</h5>
            <pre>{% verbatim example_manual_form %}
    &lt;form action="/your-name/" method="post"&gt;
        &lt;label for="your_name"&gt;Your name: &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input id="your_name" type="text" name="your_name" value="{{ current_name }}"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="OK"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
{% endverbatim example_manual_form %}</pre>
            <p class="mt-1">
                The above example tells the browser to return the form data to the URL: <em>/your-name/</em>, using the
                <em>POST</em> method. It will display a text field, labeled <u>"Your name:"</u>, and a button marked
                <u>"OK"</u>. If the template context contains a <em>current_name</em> variable, that will be used to
                pre-fill the <em>your_name</em> field. The view that renders this template containing the HTML form
                needs to supply the value for the <em>current_name</em> variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the form is submitted, the <em>POST</em> request that is sent to the server will contain the form
                data. It needs a view corresponding to the <em>/your-name/</em> URL, which will find the appropriate
                key-value pairs in the request and then process them.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a simple form but fairly time-consuming. Some more advanced features that could be added are
                browser-side validation and more complex fields (e.g. datepicker). In the below sections, we'll
                demonstrate a faster and easier way to accomplish the same task using Django's form creation feature.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="form-control mb-2">
            <a id="create_form_anchor"><h3>Creating the form class</h3></a>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The first step to using the Forms feature is to create a Python file named <em>forms.py</em> in the
                root directory of the desired application. Then, in the <em>forms.py</em> file, import <em>forms</em>
                from the <em>django</em> module:
            </p>
            <pre>
    from django import forms
</pre>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The next step is to define a Form class. Create a class with your desired name that inherits from the
                <em>forms.Form</em> class. Syntax:
            </p>
            <pre>
    from django import forms
    <strong>class <em>ExNameForm</em>(forms.Form):</strong>
</pre>
            <p class="mb-1">
                Finally, we need to add input fields to the class we just created; these fields should correspond to an
                HTML input element type (e.g. an input element with type="text" should use a CharField, type="email"
                should use EmailField, etc..).
            </p>
            <pre class="mb-1">
    from django import forms
    class <em>ExNameForm</em>(forms.Form):
        <strong>your_name = forms.CharField(label="Enter your name:", max_length=100)</strong>
</pre>
            <p class="my-1">
                In the CharField, the <em>label</em> parameter fulfills the same role as the &lt;label&gt; element,
                providing a description for the label. The <em>max_length</em> parameter specifies the upper limit for
                the number of characters permitted for the input. There are other optional CharField parameters:
                <em>min_length</em>, <em>strip</em>, and <em>empty_value</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="my-1">
                <em>Form</em> instances also have an <em>is_valid()</em> method, which runs validation routines for all
                its fields. When this method is called, if all fields contain valid data, it will do two things: return
                <em>True</em> and place the form's data in its <em>cleaned_data</em> attribute.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                The form, when rendered, will be the equivalent of the following HTML (minus the &lt;form&gt; tags,
                we'll have to supply those ourselves):
            </p>
            <pre>
    &lt;label for="your_name"&gt;Enter your name: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="your_name" type="text" name="your_name" maxlength="100" required&gt;
</pre>

            <p>
                The form data of a webpage sent back to a Django website will be processed by a corresponding view,
                typically the same view that rendered the template for that webpage. This permits reuse of some of the
                same logic.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-1">
                To handle the form, we need to instantiate it in the view for the URL where we want it to be published:

                To add the form to the HTML page, add a csrf_token, then create a template tag, supplying it with the
                name of the desired form. Create an &lt;input&gt; element tag with a <em>type</em> attribute set
                to <u>"submit"</u>. Enclose the above elements with &lt;form&gt; element tags, setting its
                <em>action</em> attribute to the desired URL and <em>method</em> attribute to <u>"post"</u>. See example
                below:

                template language. Optionally, the template variable can also call the <em>as_p</em> method, which will
                allow the form to be presented in the format of a &lt;p&gt; tag. If used, it should improve the layout
                of the form (preferences may vary, obviously). Example: <br>
                <code>{% verbatim exnameform %}{{ exnameform.<strong>as_p</strong> }}{% endverbatim exnameform %}</code>

                malicious website contains a link, a form button, or some JavaScript that is intended to perform some
                action on your website, using the credentials of a logged-in user who visits the malicious site in their

                The <em>forms</em> library comes with form fields other than CharField, such as BooleanField, DateField,
                ImageField, etc.. These fields utilize a <a href="#widgets_anchor">widget</a>, that, if not specified
                explicitly will use a default one. For each field, we can enable or disable settings that force an
                input, or edit the label/help text/error messages, as well as whether or not to enable/disable the field
                itself by editing its arguments (e.g. required, label, help_text, error_messages, disabled, etc..).
                There are also field-specific arguments that edit things such as max/min length, regex pattern matching,
                stripping, etc.. These field-specific ones may be individual to a particular field or to a type of
                field.

                                                    you can’t be certain of the input type. For example, you run the
                                                    risk of returning a datetime that was actually a string that just
                                                    happened to be in the same format chosen for datetimes. The decoder
                                                    can be used to validate the input. If json.JSONDecodeError is raised
                                                    during the deserialization, a ValidationError will be raised.
                                                    Defaults to json.JSONDecoder.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    If the built-in Field classes don’t meet your needs, you can create custom Field classes. To do
                    this, create a subclass of django.forms.Field. Its only requirements are that it implement a
                    <em>clean()</em> method and that its <em>__init__()</em> method accept the core arguments mentioned
                    above (required, label, initial, widget, help_text).
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    You can also customize how a field will be accessed by overriding <em>get_bound_field()</em>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="form-control mb-2">
                <a id="widgets_anchor"><h4>Widgets</h4></a>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    As seen in the <a href="#form_field_reference_anchor">Form Field Reference</a> section, each field
                    has a corresponding <em>Widget</em> class, which in turn corresponds to an HTML form widget such as
                    <em>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</em> in the HTML. In most cases, the field will have a sensible
                    default widget. For example, by default, a CharField will have a TextInput widget, that produces a
                    <em>&lt;input type="text"&gt;</em> in the HTML. But if we needed &lt;textarea&gt; instead, we would
                    need to specify the appropriate widget when defining the form field.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="form-control mb-1">
                <a id="field_data_anchor"><h4>Field Data</h4></a>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Whatever data is submitted with a form, once it has been validated by calling <em>is_valid()</em>
                    and if it returns <u>True</u>, the validated form data will be accessible from the
                    <em>form.cleaned_data</em> dictionary. Technically the invalidated data is accessible via
                    <em>request.POST</em> but it is not recommended to use the data in this state.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    The data stored in the <em>form.cleaned_data</em> dictionary will have been converted into Python
                    types for ease of use. Fields such as IntegerField and FloatField will be converted into Python
                    <em>int</em> and <em>float</em>, respectively.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-1">
                    Some field types need to be handled differently - such as files. For uploaded files, we need to
                    access them via <em>request.FILES</em> instead.
                </p>
